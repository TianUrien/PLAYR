# PLAYR - Field Hockey Professional Network

PLAYR is the professional network for field hockey, connecting players, coaches, and clubs in a single platform.

## What PLAYR Does

PLAYR solves a fundamental problem in field hockey: **discovery and connection**.

- **Players** struggle to find opportunities (trials, contracts, positions) beyond their local network
- **Coaches** lack visibility into coaching positions available globally
- **Clubs** have difficulty discovering talent outside their immediate region

PLAYR bridges these gaps by providing a centralized platform where all three stakeholder groups can connect professionally.

## Core Entities

### Profile
Every user has a profile with one of three roles:

| Role | Description | Key Features |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Player** | Field hockey players seeking opportunities | Position, playing history, availability status |
| **Coach** | Coaches seeking positions | Coaching experience, certifications |
| **Club** | Organizations posting opportunities | Club details, media, league information |

### Opportunity
An opportunity (job posting) created by a club, targeting either players or coaches:

- **Player Opportunities**: Positions for goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders, forwards
- **Coach Opportunities**: Coaching positions at various levels

### Application
When a player or coach applies to an opportunity:

- Application message explaining interest
- Status tracking (pending, shortlisted, rejected, withdrawn)
- Direct messaging between applicant and club

### Career History
Chronological timeline of a user's playing or coaching experience:

- Club name, position/role, dates
- League/division information
- Highlights and achievements
