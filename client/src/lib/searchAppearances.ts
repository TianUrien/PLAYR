/**
 * searchAppearances.ts
 *
 * Client-side helpers for the profile-search-appearance analytics loop.
 *
 * Write path: `logSearchAppearances` — batch-upserts one row per profile
 * currently visible in an active community search/filter result. The server
 * dedups by `(profile_id, viewer_id, hour_bucket)` so the same viewer+profile
 * in the same hour counts once, regardless of how many times the client
 * fires (typing, scroll, remount).
 *
 * Read path: `fetchSearchAppearancesSummary` — calls the SECURITY DEFINER RPC
 * `get_profile_search_appearances` to retrieve daily aggregate counts for
 * the signed-in owner. Viewer identity is never returned.
