/**
 * Phase 1A — Clarifying-question detection.
 *
 * Pure module. Decides whether a query is too vague to route or search
 * confidently and, if so, returns a deterministic clarifying question
 * with disambiguation options. Triggered by short, generic asks that
 * have a search shape but no specific entity:
 *
 *   "Find people"
 *   "Show me options"
 *   "Who can help me?"
 *   "Any recommendations?"
 *   "Search hockey"
 *
 * Without this the user gets generic LLM advice or worse — a fallthrough
 * to all-4-roles search returning mixed results. With this, they get a
 * focused 4-option pill row in <1s.
 *
 * Pure functions: no Deno globals, no fetch. Easy to unit-test.
