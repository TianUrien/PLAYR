-- Fix "Who Viewed Your Profile" brand row rendering
--
-- Two issues:
--   1. Brand viewers with incomplete onboarding (profiles row exists, but
--      brands row never created) surfaced in the list with NULL full_name
--      and avatar_url — rendered as a purple "?" with an empty name.
--   2. The RPC never returned brand_slug, so the frontend had no way to link
--      a brand viewer to its profile (brand pages are /brands/:slug).
--
-- Fix: LEFT JOIN brands so we can (a) return brand_slug and (b) require a
-- brands row for brand-role viewers — a narrow filter that only affects
-- brands, leaving player/coach/club behavior unchanged. Preserve the
-- bidirectional block filter added in 202603250500.
